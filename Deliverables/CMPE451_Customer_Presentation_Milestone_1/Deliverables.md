# Individual Contributions

<details>
    <summary> Serdar Akol </summary>
I am Serdar Akol, a member of group 8. I am working on the Mobile Development part of the project.

### Responsibilities
* Researching different mobile application development tools.
* Setting the environment for the mobile development.
* Learning basic Flutter/Dart to implement the initial pages.
* Reviewing and updating the requirements.

### Main Contributions
I have revised the requirements and contributed on the decisions we were making reltated to the functionalities of our project. I have attended to all of our meetings. I have searched different mobile application development tools. I have set the development environment for the development but unforetunately I could not contirubute any code for this milestone due to overload of my other classes. I promise I will be contributing more while we continiue to develop.

    <summary> Elif Bayraktar </summary>
I am Elif Bayraktar, a member of group 8. I am working on the backend of the project.

### Responsibilities
* Reviewing/updating requirements (Bidding system, Notifications, Level and Verification Systems)
* Researching different authentication and authorization mechanisms to set up our project the right way.
* Implementing the itinital models for the project.
* Implementing serializers and creating the admin site.
* Implementation of alternative registration API, using django authentication.
* Researching and implementing CICD workflow.

### Main Contributions
I revised the requirements, contributed to some decisions. I extensively researched authentication and authorization mechanisms (creating custom user class vs. extending base) to make sure we set up the project the right way, and to avoid any headaches in the future. I implemented the initial models. I also implemented serializers for the models, some decorators for future use and the admin site. I also tested the API's developed by other members and developed the alternative registeration API, to test if there were any problems with using django authentication. Finally I researched, learned and implemented CICD workflow with testing and dockerization with GitHub Actions (this part is on hold until we access secrets via settings). I also went over and updated some of the mockups.

* Research on frontend tools.
* Providing authentication for login and signup.
* Providing connection to backend.
* Dockerization of frontend.

### Main Contributions
I have created the first view for login and signup pages while creating the frontend project. I shared my knowledge about frontend tools with my teammate. Then, I studied and worked on authentication and tokenizaton for login and sign up. I configured backend and database on local in order to test if authentication and tokenization works well. I did research on dockerization of frontend projects and dockerize it.

* 
**Additional Information**
* First, I have created project in [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/s/artcommunityplatform-ilgl9c?file=/src/Login.js) to experience css tools.Then, Furkan Keskin took the responsibility of creating design by using css. That's way, he uploaded the project to git.
* I did not create a pr to merge authentication file to the branch 'feature/FE-3' because I have already downloaded updated backend folder to my branch to test if everything worked well. Not to destruct folder structure, Furkan Keskin copied the only authentication file manually to his branch.
