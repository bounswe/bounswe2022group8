## 5. API Endpoints
**Author: Karahan Sarıtaş**

* You can find the documentation of our API endpoints here: http://34.125.134.88:8000/api/v1/swagger/schema/ 
We used Swagger to document our APIs and provide exemplary inputs/outputs for other teams. Please notice that you have to authorize yourself in order to test some of the APIs (since these can be called only by logged-in users in our application - not by guest users).
* There is this button called ```Authorize``` on the right corner in Swagger page. We have to use it to test APIs that require authorization. For example, in order to test the ```logout``` API, first you have to log in to the application and have a token with you. Try the ```login``` endpoint first, copy paste the token returned to you and click on the ```Authorize``` button. Input the token in the following format: "Token xxx". Replace `xxx` with the token and don't forget to put a space between the first word and your token. You can refer to this [PR](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group8/pull/245) for more details if you want.
* By using Swagger, you can test any API you want either with the example input we provided or some other input that complies with the specification.
* Let me provide the Postman Collection [here](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2022group8/blob/feature/MIL/Deliverables/CMPE451_Customer_Presentation_Milestone_2/CmpE451%20API.postman_collection.json). `{{prod}}` stands for `34.125.134.88`.
